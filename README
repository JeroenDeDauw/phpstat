This is some simple, and probably crappy, Python utility to compute and display
basic statistics for PHP and JavaScript projects (such as most MediaWiki extensions).

I mainly wrote this as exercice to get a better feel on Python modules and packages,
simple data structures, control flow, and classes.

Needs some nicifying to make it generally usable :)
